# Weather-Downloader
Want to show the weather information in your app, here is a simple and efficient solution for you.
Now show the weather information you need in your app without deviating away from your app's core idea.
This is a helper library to get basic weather information into your app (not into a weather app of course).
It uses the openweathermap api to get the weather data. Please note that this is still in beta phase and is limited to
get the current weather conditions only. Forecast and Historical data will be added in future.
